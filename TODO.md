# Feedback & TODO

## Quick Fixes
- [ ] Smooth card dealing animation — First card slides jerkily when second card is dealt
- [ ] Dynamic card overlap — Cards should compress/overlap when hitting multiple times to stay in bounds
- [ ] Joker sidebar copy — Update the text on the joker pending indicator

## Completed
- [x] Fix 3 of diamonds card — Added white background to `assets/cards/diamonds_3.png`
- [x] Unified result modal — Redesigned as capture/joker modal with inline results for simple outcomes

## Ideas / Maybe Later
- [ ] Split functionality
- [ ] Variable bet amounts
- [ ] Win/loss statistics
- [ ] Sound effects (off by default)
- [ ] More celebratory blackjack animation
